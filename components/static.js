    <h2>This Calculator is better than yours.</h2>
    <p>
      Sorry, that was rude. What I mean is, most calculator apps kind of suck.
      They're rudimentary, inflexible, and just not that useful.
    </p>
    <p>But not this one. </p>
    <p>
      This one lets you see your entire formula and dynamically renders the
      output in a seperate display. Achieving this is more complicated than it
      sounds. For one, the formula displayed is not the same as the one used for
      calculations. To this end, a display formula and a computational formula
      need to be maintained at all times. So a formula that looks like this
    </p>
    <code>55ร15%รท9</code>
    <p>is actually computing this</p>
    <code>55*0.15/9</code>
    <p>
      As you might be able to imagine, this makes percentages particularly
      tricky. Especially when the delete button is factored in (easily the most
      complicated button). But I believe all of this effort is worthwhile, as
      the results are intuitive, functional, and powerful, as I hope you'll
      agree.
